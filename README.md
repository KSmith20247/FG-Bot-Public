For any recruiter looking at this, please note this project was completed in its entirety BEFORE I had taken any OOP class. At this point, I was completely self taught in class design, modularity, and organization. That is why it is a mess. 

It does however, successfully implement the Discord API for player gui, supabase API for SQL database management, and has its own local .replay file (for rocket league games) parsing library. It worked quite well all things considered. I'd love to talk more about it
